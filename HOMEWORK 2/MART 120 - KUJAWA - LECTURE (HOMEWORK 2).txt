What affected me the most was how much fun he was having while doing this presentation. There were a lot of interactive parts to it like the giant stuffed animals, the football, the mad hatter hat, and the letterman jacket to the pushups. He is a good salesman because I listened to his whole lecture and I didn’t even realize an hour had passed. He was able to keep the audience engaged in this lecture because with some lectures that I’ve watched the crowd can be very dead, but they love him and I think that’s because many of the people in the audience were his students or a part of the projects he’s contributed to. They were there to support him because he was such a supportive piece of their lives. Also how lucky he was to have these experiences and meet the people that he’s met. To have those connections and have supportive people who can push you up to new levels is something I wished for as a kid. I also love his demeanor, I had a teacher in high school and I learned a lot from him during online schooling during the pandemic times they had a similar demeanor which sent me back to the feeling of when I took his class. I found it interesting that some of the advice he puts out near the end is some that I follow already, but I’ll just keep pushing forward to see where it can take me. I want to win one of those big stuffed animals, but they cost a lot of money if you’re not good at the games.
