Learning styles put a label on our preferences of how we like to learn. These learning styles are a good baseline to start on ways to accommodate oneself to different situations of learning. After I read the article I understood that it’s not something we should base everything on, and I thought it's similar to personality types it’s not a one-size-fits kind of thing like anything. There is some truth to the learning styles, I found that I’m more of a visual learner. That explains why I struggle with auditory instructions by themselves but if it comes with a video with captions or visuals, I’m much more able to absorb that information.
