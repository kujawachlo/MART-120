    <span3 class="pinkColor">Favorite Story - "Don't Forget The Oatmeal" written by: B.G. Ford</span3>
<br>
<br>
Don't Forget the Oatmeal! is a 1980 Sesame Street storybook that centers on Ernie and Bert's shopping expedition. Bert ties a string around his finger to ensure that he won't forget the oatmeal, the most crucial item that was not written in a long list. The pair go to the supermarket but are soon distracted by Cookie Monster, who finds that the store is having a cookie sale.

Cookie Monster gorges himself on all manner of cookies, with a few peas for good measure, leaving a trail of crumbs, broken cookies, and empty boxes in his wake. Bert dutifully reminds Cookie to pay for what he consumed and broke, but forgets all about the oatmeal in the process.
