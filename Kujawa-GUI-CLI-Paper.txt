GUIs are a digital interface with which the user interacts, it uses icons/pictures/buttons to execute commands. CLIs are also an interface but they have characters and text that are used to make those commands work. GUIs are accessible to most people since its more intuitive, while CLIs are difficult to use for beginners like myself since I don’t understand those specific commands they require higher precision, and spelling mistakes can’t be avoided. They are commonly used by programmers and other tech-wiz’s. GUIs although very accessible won’t be accessible to those with a slow computer. CLIs have direct command input with text so there are no pictures needed to be loaded, which makes GUIs slower in comparison because of those graphical features. When deciding which interface they want to use, they have to consider their audience. There’s a bigger learning curve when it comes to CLIs, but that is why GUIs are more popular.
